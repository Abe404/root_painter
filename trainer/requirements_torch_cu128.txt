# Custom minimal PyTorch wheels (CUDA 12.8, Blackwell sm_120)
# Built without: nccl, cusparse, cusparselt, cufft, cusolver, distributed, triton
#
# These URLs are a fallback for CI / builds without local wheels.
# For local builds: ./build_custom_torch.sh outputs wheels to ./dist/
# and build_workstation_ubuntu_cuda128.sh picks them up automatically.
