# Q: Should we use many arguments passed to pyinstaller, or should we use a spec file?
"""
A:
From: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/fbf7948be85177dd44b41217e9f039e1d176de6b/doc/spec-files.rst

`For many uses of PyInstaller you do not need to examine or modify the spec
file. It is usually enough to give all the needed information (such as
hidden imports) as options to the pyinstaller command and let it run.

There are four cases where it is useful to modify the spec file:

1. When you want to bundle data files with the app.
2. When you want to include run-time libraries (.dll or .so files) that
   PyInstaller does not know about from any other source.
3. When you want to add Python run-time options to the executable.
4. When you want to create a multiprogram bundle with merged common modules.'


So the plan for now is to go with more options passed to PyInstaller, and then
only move onto using a custom spec file when this is recommended by the above
advice.
