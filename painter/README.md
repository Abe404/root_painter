Installers for OSX, Windows and Debian based linux distrubtions are avilable from the following URL which is recommended for most users:
https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/releases
Alternatively the painter source code can be ran directly using the python 3 interpreter.
The server (trainer) must be running for the client to function.

## Install dependencies 
I typically suggest using a virtual environment for this.
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
