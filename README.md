## RootPainter

Code for the project "RootPainter: Deep Learning Segmentation of Biological Images with Corrective Annotation"

RootPainter is a GUI-based software tool for the rapid training of deep neural networks for use in biological image analysis. 
RootPainter uses a client-server architecture, allowing users with a typical laptop to utilise a GPU on a more computationally powerful server.
