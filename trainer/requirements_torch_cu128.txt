# Custom minimal PyTorch wheels (CUDA 12.8, Blackwell sm_120)
# Built without: nccl, cusparse, cusparselt, cufft, cusolver, distributed, triton
#
# These URLs are a fallback for CI / builds without local wheels.
# For local builds: ./build_custom_torch.sh outputs wheels to ./dist/
# and build_workstation_ubuntu_cuda128.sh picks them up automatically.

# CUDA runtime libraries needed by the custom torch wheel.
# The custom wheel is built against the system CUDA toolkit and does NOT
# declare pip dependencies on these, so we install them explicitly.
# Deliberately excluded: nvidia-nccl, nvidia-cusparse, nvidia-cusparselt,
# nvidia-cufft, nvidia-cusolver (not used by RootPainter).
