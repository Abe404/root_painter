#### Question - [Skipping to images](https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/issues/59)
I wanted to skip back to the first few images I've used to show the annotation approach/progress. Is there any easier way to do it than pressing back and waiting for each image to load?

#### Answer:
With the project open, go to the extras menu and view metrics plot. Then click on the image point in the metrics plot and it will take you to the corresponding image in the viewer.
