#### Question - [Skipping to images](https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/issues/59)
I wanted to skip back to the first few images I've used to show the annotation approach/progress. Is there any easier way to do it than pressing back and waiting for each image to load?
If not it would be handy to have a 'skip to index' or 'skip to start' option for this kind of purpose.

#### Answer:
With the project open, go to the extras menu and view metrics plot. Then click on the image point in the metrics plot and it will take you to the corresponding image in the viewer.
